              For this project, my client and I collaborated to create a website
              that was both visually striking and highly effective in reaching
              the target audience. To ensure that the website would attract
              organic traffic, I conducted thorough
              <span class="highlight">SEO research</span> to guide the creation
              of the text content. In addition to
              <span class="highlight">design and content</span>, I took care of
              the technical aspects of the website. I selected a
              <span class="highlight">reliable web hosting provider</span> to
              ensure fast loading times and minimal downtime. I also
              <span class="highlight">bought the domain </span>with specific
              keywords that aligned with my client's business goals, further
              boosting the website's search engine optimization.

              For this project, my client provided a design concept, and I
              brought it to life with a focus on
              <span class="highlight">adaptability and responsiveness.</span>
              The primary goal was to ensure that the website would look and
              function seamlessly across all devices, from desktops to tablets
              to smartphones. To help my client
              <span class="highlight"
                >track and analyze visitor interactions,</span
              >
              I integrated
              <span class="highlight">Google Tag Manager,</span> providing a
              robust platform for managing and deploying tracking codes. This
              would give my client valuable insights into user behavior and help
              guide
              <span class="highlight">marketing strategies.</span> Additionally,
              I created a custom form that is linked to
              <span class="highlight">my client's HubSpot account</span>,
              allowing them to capture leads and manage customer relationships
              more effectively. The personalized form was designed to collect
              the right information and
              <span class="highlight"
                >integrate seamlessly with their existing CRM workflow.</span
